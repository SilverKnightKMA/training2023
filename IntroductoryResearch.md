> The user passwords are stored in a hashed format in a registry hive either as an LM hash or as an NTLM hash.
> >các password được mã hóa ở dạng LM hash hoặc NTLM hash nhưng LM hash có tính bảo mật yếu hơn nên thường sẽ dùng NTLM hash.
> >LAN Manager authentication uses a particularly weak method of hashing a user's password known as the LM hash algorithm, stemming from the mid 1980s when viruses transmitted by floppy disks were the major concern.[6] Although it is based on DES, a well-studied block cipher, the LM hash has several weaknesses in its design.[7] This makes such hashes crackable in a matter of seconds using rainbow tables, or in a few minutes using brute force. Starting with Windows NT, it was replaced by NTLM, which is still vulnerable to rainbow tables, and brute force attacks unless long, unpredictable passwords are used, see password cracking.
